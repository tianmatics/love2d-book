## Your First Look at Love2D Code

Here's a simple "Hello World" example:

```lua
function love.load()
    -- This runs once at the start
    font = love.graphics.newFont(24)
    love.graphics.setFont(font)
end

function love.update(dt)
    -- This runs every frame
    -- dt = delta time (time since last frame)
end

function love.draw()
    -- This draws everything on screen
    love.graphics.print("Hello, Love2D World!", 100, 100)
    love.graphics.circle("fill", 400, 300, 50)
end
```
